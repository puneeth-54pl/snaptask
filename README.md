# snaptask
SnapTask is a minimal to-do list app designed to quickly capture and organize tasks â€” even from external sources like web text, email, or messages. Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, it's beginner-friendly and open-source, with plans to support one-click capture via a Chrome extension and Supabase backend.
